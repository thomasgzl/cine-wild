# CINE-WILD -checkpoint
## NodeJS + React 

This repository contains the last NodeJS/React checkpoint we did @ Wild Code School.
Open the PDF document called "Final checkpoint - JS" to see instructions.

I created database, routes. I used fetch to get data from my database.
I used React to do pages, to display all the movies and filter by categories.
